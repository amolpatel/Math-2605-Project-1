To compile and run the code for part 1, please ensure a recent version of Java is installed on your computer.

After that, the code can be compiled via the following command:
javac Part1Driver.java

That will create the necessary .class files, and the code can then be run with the command:
java Part1Driver

Included in this folder are a PDF and Word document of the written component associated with part 1 (included both in case one is easier to read).
