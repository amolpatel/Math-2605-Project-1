To compile and run the code for part 1, please ensure a recent version of Java is installed on your computer.

Navigate to the directory src/Part2.
After that, the code can be compiled via the following command:
javac -cp ../ Part1Driver.java

That will create the necessary .class files, and the code can then be run with the command:
java -cp ../ Part1/Part1Driver
