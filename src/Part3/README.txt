Part 3 of the project can be run by following these steps:

1) Navigate to the folder containing Part3 (depends on where you saved it in your computer) of the project through the terminal

2) Compile Part3Driver.java with the following command, which will create the .class file for Part3Driver.java so that you can then run the file: javac Part3Driver.java

3) Now, run Part3Driver.java with the following command: java Part3Driver

4) Follow the directions on the console by entering the paths for the files with the required matrices (initial eigenvector and matrix A), and the desired tol value.

5) You should now have your desired answer: the approximated eigenvalue, Î», and approximated eigenvector, v, and the number of iterations needed to achieve the desired error tolerance.


This folder also has the written component for Part 3.
