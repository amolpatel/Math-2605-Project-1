\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 To compile and run the code for part 2, please ensure a recent version of Java is installed on your computer.\
\
After that, the code can be compiled via the following command:\
javac Part2Driver.java\
\
That will create the necessary .class files, and the code can then be run with the command:\
java Part2Driver\
\
The system will print options for choosing which method you would like to run.\
\
Options 1 and 2 read an augmented matrix from a file in the form [A|b] with space as delimiter between columns and return as delimiter between rows.\
\
Options 3, 5, 7, 9, 10, 12, and 13 read a vector from a file in the form b horizontal or vertical with space as delimiter between columns/rows.\
\
Some of these options may ask for user input such as desired length of random input stream X/output stream Y, choice of A0/A1, as well as tolerance levels.\
\
\
Included in this folder are a PDF and Word document of the written component associated with part 2 (included both in case one is easier to read).\
