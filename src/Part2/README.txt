To compile and run the code for part 2, please ensure a recent version of Java is installed on your computer.

After that, the code can be compiled via the following command:
javac Part2Driver.java

That will create the necessary .class files, and the code can then be run with the command:
java Part2Driver

The system will print options for choosing which method you would like to run.

Options 1 and 2 read an augmented matrix from a file in the form [A|b] with space as delimiter between columns and return as delimiter between rows.

Options 3, 5, 7, 9, 10, 12, and 13 read a vector from a file in the form b horizontal or vertical with space as delimiter between columns/rows.

Some of these options may ask for user input such as desired length of random input stream X/output stream Y, choice of A0/A1, as well as tolerance levels.

When trying to decode y_bar to obtain x_bar, run option 9 for Y0 and option 10 for Y1 to get a result using Gauss-Seidel.

When trying to decode y_bar to obtain x_bar, run option 9 for Y0 and option 10 for Y1 to get a result using Jacobi.

Included in this folder are a PDF and Word document of the written component associated with part 2 (included both in case one is easier to read).
